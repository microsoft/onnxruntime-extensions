# ONNX Runtime Custom Ops Library
This repository provides a library of add-on custom operators for [ONNX Runtime](http://onnxruntime.ai). The package can be installed to run with ONNX Runtime for operators not natively supported by ORT. Learn more about [custom ops in ORT](https://www.onnxruntime.ai/docs/how-to/add-custom-op.html). 

# Build and Development
This project supports Python and can be built from source easily.
## Python package
- Install Visual Studio with C++ development tools on Windows, or gcc for Linux or xcode for MacOS, and cmake on the unix-like platform.
- Prepare Python env and install the pip packages in the requirements.txt.
- `python setup.py install` to build and install the package.
- OR `python setup.py develop` to install the package in the development mode, which is more friendly for the developer since (re)installation is not needed with every build.

Test:
- run `pytest test` in the project root directory.

## The share library or DLL only
If only DLL/shared library is needed without any Python dependencies, please run `build.bat` or `bash ./build.sh` to build the library.
By default the DLL or the library will be generated in the directory `out/<OS>/<FLAVOR>`. There is a unit test to help verify the build.
