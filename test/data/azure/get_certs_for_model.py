# Curl + openssl has issues reading the system certificates on Android.
# Pending a better solution we create an in-memory certificate store from certificates included in the model.
#
# The certificates must be added to the first Azure operator in the model in an attribute called 'x509_certificates'.
# The user must determine the correct certificates for their scenario, and add them to the model.
# The PEM file from https://curl.se/docs/caextract.html may be used.
#
# Include this file in the python script that is creating your model with Azure custom operators.
# Get the value to use in the 'x509_certificates' attribute from either a file (call get_certs_from_file) or
# a url (call get_certs_from_url)
# 
# See create_openai_whisper_transcriptions.py for example usage.
#
# Notes:
#
# - Supposedly if openssl uses md5 hashing for the certificates in /system/etc/security/cacerts it should work, but
# a patched version of openssl with this change still failed.
# - The 'better' solution might be to use boringssl instead of openssl as it handles the certificate format in
# /system/etc/security/cacerts, although even that is potentially problematic as there's no versioning of boringssl.
