# Build and Development

This project supports Python and can be built from source easily, or a simple cmake build without Python dependency.

## Python package

The package contains all custom operators and some Python scripts to manipulate the ONNX models.

- Install Visual Studio with C++ development tools on Windows, or gcc(>8.0) for Linux or xcode for macOS, and cmake on the unix-like platform.
- If running on Windows, ensure that long file names are enabled, both for the [operating system](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/maximum-file-path-limitation?tabs=cmd) and for git: `git config --system core.longpaths true`
- Make sure the Python development header/library files be installed, (like `apt-get install python3-dev` for Ubuntu Linux)
- `pip install .` to build and install the package.<br/> OR `pip install -e .` to install the package in the development mode, which is more friendly for the developer since the Python code change will take effect without having to copy the files to a different location in the disk.(**hints**: debug=1 in setup.cfg wil make C++ code be debuggable in a Python process.)
- Add the following argument `--config-settings "ortx-user-option=use-cuda"` in the pip command line to enable **CUDA** kernels for the package.
- The flags that can be used in --config-settings are:
  - use-cuda: enable CUDA kernel build in Python package.
  - no-azure: disable AzureOp kernel build in Python package.
  - no-opencv: disable operators based on OpenCV in build.
  - cc-debug: Generate debug info for extensions binaries and disable C/C++ compiler optimization.

   For example:`pip install . --config-settings "ortx-user-option=use-cuda,cc-debug" `, This command builds CUDA kernels into the package and installs it, accompanied by the generation of debug information.

Test:

- 'pip install -r requirements-dev.txt' to install pip packages for development.
- run `pytest test` in the project root directory.

## Java package

`bash ./build.sh -DOCOS_BUILD_JAVA=ON` to build jar package in out/<OS>/Release folder

## Android package

- pre-requisites: [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)

Use `./tools/android/build_aar.py` to build an Android AAR package.

## iOS package

Use `./tools/ios/build_xcframework.py` to build an iOS xcframework package.

## NuGet package

In order to build a local NuGet package for testing, run `nuget.exe pack ./nuget/WinOnlyNuget.nuspec` to build a NuGet package for Windows.

Note: you might need to update the src paths in the ./nuget/WinOnlyNuget.nuspec file if the appropriate ortextensions.dll files do not exist/are not in the given location.

## Web-Assembly

ONNXRuntime-Extensions will be built as a static library and linked with ONNXRuntime due to the lack of a good dynamic linking mechanism in WASM. Here are two additional arguments [â€“-use_extensions and --extensions_overridden_path](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/blob/860ba8820b72d13a61f0d08b915cd433b738ffdc/tools/ci_build/build.py#L416) on building onnxruntime to include ONNXRuntime-Extensions footprint in the ONNXRuntime package.

## The C++ shared library

For any alternative scenarios, execute the following commands:

- On Windows: Run `build.bat`.
- On Unix-based systems: Execute `bash ./build.sh`.

The generated DLL or library is typically located in the `out/<OS>/<FLAVOR>` directory. To validate the build, utilize the unit tests available in the `test/test_static_test` and `test/shared_test` directories.

**VC Runtime static linkage**  
If you want to build the binary with VC Runtime static linkage, please add a parameter _-DCMAKE_MSVC_RUNTIME_LIBRARY="MultiThreaded$<$<CONFIG:Debug>:Debug>"_ when running build.bat
